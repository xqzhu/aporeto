# Python/Go sample
- Python
- Divide files until they can be solved, and then merger them to get the result
- Not compelete, just a simulation
- To run the code, use big_file.txt as uploaded and change parameters according to comments in the file
- output.txt is the output file. Just to Mention that this method does not keep the sequence, which I should though of before
